# RiskDetect: Risk Identification and Analysis Tool

**RiskDetect** is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) tool designed to analyze textual data and assess potential risks. The tool extracts entities from the text, performs sentiment analysis, calculates a risk score based on sentiment and entities, and identifies relevant topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Visualizations are provided to highlight the risk factors.

## Features



- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key entities such as organizations, locations, money, and laws from the text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates a risk score based on extracted entities and sentiment.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies topics in the text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of risk factors.
